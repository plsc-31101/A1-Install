#### 1. Using R Markdown {-}

In the space below, insert a picture of yourself, and complete the following information:

1. __Name__: Daenerys Targaryen
2. __Department and degree program__: Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains.
3. __Year in the program__: First.
4. __One-sentence description of academic interests__: I am interested in slavery, intercontinental conflict, and pyrology.
5. __Some non-academic interests__: Dragons, Jon Snow, eating raw hearts.
6. __R version installed on your computer__ (Open a command line window ('terminal' or, on windows, 'git bash'), and enter the following command `R --version`): 3.6.1
7. __R Studio version installed on your computer__ (Open RStudio and, in the navigation menu, click on RStudio --> About RStudio): 1.1.456
8. __Primary computer operating system__ (Mac OS, Windows, Linux, etc): Mac OS 10.13.6.
9. __Programming experience__ (How would you describe your previous programming experience?): None.

#### 2. Checking packages {-}

Create an R chunk below, where you load the `tidyverse` library.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

#### 3. Knit and submit. {-}

Knit the R Markdown file to PDF. Submit __BOTH__ the .Rmd file and the PDF file to Canvas. 

If you get an error trying to knit, read the error and make sure that your R code is correct. If that doesn't work, confirm you've correctly installed the requisite packages (`knit`, `rmarkdown`). If you still can't get it to work, paste the error on Canvas.
